#                                  Biometric Attendance System Over IOT

##                                        Objective  
Here we propose a smart fingerprint based biometric attendance system that works over IOT so that attendance can be monitored from anywhere in the world. The efficacy in the procedure of getting student’s/employee’s attendance can be maximized when the IOT Based Biometric attendance system i.e. smart attendance system is used. The student’s/employee’s attendance is recorded using biometric scanner which is fingerprint based and then the data is secured safely over a cloud storage.


##                                      Working Process
1. First we will power the device and connect the NodeMCU to WIFI.
2. First of all we recorde the employee’s name on the website. and then recorde the finger through finger print sensor.
3. After successful registration employee puts finger on fingerprint sensor to record attendance then his/her data goes to server and is verified and his/her attendance interval is recorded automatically in website.
4. Now attendance is done

### Create Your Own project then Use these instruction 
In this code Change your wifi name and password.


creare your server and upload link to host.
for example:-  host = "your server link"


now add your employee in data base and record his/her finger in your database though fingerprint sensor  


then connect NodeMCU to your pc and upload the code


And now ready your project...............
